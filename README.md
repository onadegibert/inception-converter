# Inception Converter
Converter from XML annotation format to Web Anno TSV v3.2.
I named it Inception Converter as my goal was to be able to import annotated files into [Inception](https://inception-project.github.io/).


It is originally thought for the [Meddocan Corpus](https://temu.bsc.es/meddocan/index.php/datasets/). 

To transform your corpus from BRAT format, please, first use the [Meddocan Format Converter script](https://github.com/PlanTL-SANIDAD/MEDDOCAN-Format-Converter-Script)
and then use this converter.

## Usage

``python3 converter.py -i input_dir -o output_dir``

## Data
You can use the sample text in the **test** folder.
